### Implementation of the SGD in PDF_Chi2

This repository contains the attempt to implement the Stochastic Gradient Descent for DIS and DY observables by minimising Chi_square. The task is mainly divided into two main projects:

* Check the analytical derivation of the SGD for DIS and DY observables and compare the results to the numerical implementation using Polynomials. This is implemented inside the folder [toypdf](https://github.com/Radonirinaunimi/SGD_XiSquare/tree/master/toypdf). For DY observables for examples, the results agree

* Replace the polynomials by a Neural Network. This part is still under development in [NN](https://github.com/Radonirinaunimi/SGD_XiSquare/tree/master/NN)
